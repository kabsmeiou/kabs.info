            <p className='md:text-sm opacity-75 text-xs'>
              Iâ€™m currently a 3rd Year Computer Science student in Ateneo de Naga University. I am an INTJ. I enjoy problem-solving, which is why I participate in competitive programming competitions quite often. Other than programming, I play the piano from time to time, engage in contact sports such as basketball, and play chess. Right now, I am learning about Machine Learning. I am aspiring to be a great Machine Learning Engineer.
